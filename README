# Employee Management System

## Overview

The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application built using Django (backend) and React (frontend). It provides an interface for managing companies, departments, and employees. The system allows an admin user to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these entities after logging in.

## Features

### Backend (Django)
- Models:
  - **User Accounts** (Admin, Employee)
  - **Company** (Company name, number of departments, employees)
  - **Department** (Belongs to a company, number of employees)
  - **Employee** (Belongs to a department and company, employee details)
- Business Logic & Validations:
  - Auto-calculates employee tenure and department/company statistics
  - Validates email and phone number formats
  - Restricts departments to their respective companies
  - Implements role-based access control
- RESTful API:
  - Endpoints for CRUD operations on companies, departments, and employees
  - Secure authentication and authorization

### Frontend (React)
- **Login Page**: Secure login for admin users.
- **Dashboard**: Displays management options (Companies, Departments, Employees).
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Company Management**: List, view, edit, delete companies.
  - **Department Management**: List, view, edit, delete departments.
  - **Employee Management**: List, view, edit, delete employees.
- **Validations**:
  - Ensures required fields are filled correctly
  - Handles errors with user-friendly messages
- **API Integration**:
  - Uses the backend API for data management
  - Handles authentication and authorization
